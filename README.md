## 🌍 The Problem: A Silent Struggle  
In India, mental health is often a silent struggle, shrouded in stigma.  
For young adults and students, the immense pressure of academics and social life creates a heavy burden, yet seeking help is seen as a sign of weakness.  

Professional care is often inaccessible due to high costs and a lack of resources, leaving millions feeling isolated.  

👉 We built **Zenith Path** to be the first step on the journey to wellness—a private, non-judgmental space that's always available.

## ✨ Our Solution: Zenith Path

## 💡 The Ideation  
Our core idea: create a solution that feels **less like a clinical tool and more like a supportive companion**.  

### Principles  
1. **Anonymity & Safety First**  
   - Engage anonymously with AI chat & streaks  
   - Social features are **opt-in** for full user control  

2. **Gamification for Habit Building**  
   - Inspired by **Duolingo** streaks  
   - Rewards daily check-ins  
   - Encourages long-term positive habits  

3. **Community over Isolation**  
   - Friend system & community wall foster belonging  
   - Celebrate progress together  
   - Show users they’re **not alone**
